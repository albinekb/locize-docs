Integrating locize into your website / application takes four steps. If you still got questions after reading the getting started guide - [contact us](mailto:support@locize.com).

# Step 1) SignUp and create a project

Head over to our app and [register](https://www.locize.io/register). Create your first project on the dashboard or open [https://www.locize.io/project/add](https://www.locize.io/project/add) after login.

# Step 2) Decide for a i18n instrumentation

Next you will need to instrument your code to enable the internationalization of your website. For more details on that read the [instrument your code section](/instrumenting-your-code.md).


# Step 3) Add new / existing segments

You can add new segments or complete files using the webinterface or the [commandline tool](https://github.com/locize/locize-cli).
